Update Notes for AER RRTM

RRTM_LW v3.3

Date: June 2010


     * Updated water vapor continuum absorption coefficients are consistent with those in MT_CKD 2.5.

     * Scattering capability is available through the radiative transfer solver DISORT [Stamnes et al., 1988].

     * Ice cloud scattering optical properties for the Fu et al. [1998] parameterization (hexagonal particles) 
     and for the STREAMER v3.0 code (spherical particles) have been included.

     * Options for users to directly input cloud and aerosol absorption and scattering optical 
     properties have been expanded (INFLAG equals 0 or 10 in IN_CLD_RRTM file).

     * Output file (OUT_CLD_RRTM) containing cloud optical properties used in model calculation is 
     now generated.

     * Code fix to taumol.f to revise use of the binary species parameter in some spectral bands. 
     Results are changed in profiles with low water vapor and low temperature: downward surface 
     fluxes are typically increased by this change by about 0.1 W m-2, with downward flux in some 
     layers increased by as much as 0.5 W m2 in some profiles, upward flux changes are smaller.

     * Updated physical constants to be consistent with NIST [2010].

     * Updated the atmospheric ray trace program (rrtatm) to be consistent with LBLRTM v11.7.

     * Updated formatting in the OUTPUT_RRTM file.

     * Single makefile applies for a wide range of computing platforms. 
 
RRTM_LW v3.01

Date: Sept 2002 
 
	* Identical to v3.0 except for minor changes to the makefiles provided with the 
	distribution of RRTM. The RRTM source code is identical between release v3.0 and release v3.01.

RRTM_LW v3.0

Date: August 2002 
 
	* The line parameters for species other than water vapor were obtained from HITRAN 1996 
	database (http://www.hitran.com). The water vapor lines from 500.0 to 2880. cm-1 were 
	replaced with those measured by Dr. Bob Toth (JPL).These parameters for water vapor are 
	consistent with the HITRAN 2000 database.Line coupling coefficients have been utilized for 
	the important Q-branches ofcarbon dioxide.These line coupling coefficients have been 
	updated for consistency with the HITRAN 1996 carbon dioxide line strengths.

	* The water vapor continuum absorption coefficients were obtained from CKD 2.4. Note that 
	contributions to the optical depth from both the self and foreign water vapor continuum are 
	now explicitly calculated.Continuum contributions from nitrogen are now included.

	* RRTM calculates fluxes and cooling rates in the longwave spectral region (from 10 to 3250 cm-1).
	Note that in the previous version, RRTM v2.3, the spectral region extended only to 3000 cm-1.

	* The errors in computed stratospheric cooling rates have been substantially reduced.
	In RRTM v3.0 the average maximum stratospheric cooling rate error (for a representative 
	set of 43 atmospheric profiles) is 0.27 K/day, compared with an average error of 0.53 K/day for RRTM v2.3.

	* The fluxes and cooling rates computed in RRTM v3.0 are greatly improved for atmospheres 
	having abundances of trace gases (e.g. CO2, CH4) substantially different from current abundances.

	* Cloudy-sky radiative transfer calculations include new options:

		- Radiative transfer algorithms for cloudy layers with random or maximum/random overlap.
		- Ice particle parameterization from Fu, Yang, and Sun (J. Climate, Vol 11, 1998, pp. 2223 - 2237).

	* Capability to input atmospheric profile on either altitude or pressure grid, and to 
	output quantities on either altitude or pressure grid.
	
	* The source function in each layer is now computed using the exact linear in tau approach, 
	in contrast to the use of a Pade approximant in RRTM v2.3.Both the exponential function 
	and the exact 'linear in tau' function are tabulated at 5000 values and a table lookup is 
	used in the radiative transfer calculation.It should be noted that this adds a small 
	element of discreteness into the calculation. (This methodology is consistent with LBLRTM v6.0.)

	* Makefiles for creating single precision executables for a number of platforms have been included.

	* A set of sample RRTM input files has been included in the tar file in a directory called /sample_runs/.

	* The instruction manual has been updated.It includes important changes to many options, such as the number of angles used in the flux calculations, the declaration of either random or maximum/random cloud overlap assumption etc.
