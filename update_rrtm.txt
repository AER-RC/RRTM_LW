Update Note for AER RRTM

July 1, 2005

	Release_3_2

	Not publicly released at this time.  

	- Fixed bug in rtrdis.f: heating rate calculation needed a "-" in front
		of variable heatfac to produce appropriate sign (Note: RRTM_LW and RRTM_SW
		were designed to keep the net flux positive for both spectral regimes, thereby
		necessitating the "-" sign for the LW heating rate calculations).
	- Fixed minor bugs in taumol, setcoef, k_gB15 
	- Fixed other minor bugs
	- Added Absoft Pro Fortran Compiler makefile for MAC OS_X

July 29, 2004

	Release_3_1

	- Fixed bug in the digits of PI in rrtm.f
	- Created rtrdis to call DISORT v2 to do scattering calculations
	- Modified disort v2 to do double precision, and change sgi makefile to compile in double
	- Modified cldprop to do scattering.  
		* Updated the cldprop spheres to use latest streamer version 3.0. 
		* Remade Fu properties on finer grid.  
		* Modified documentation. 
		* Now output a file called OUT_CLD_RRTM with the cloud optical properties.  
	- Added patent statement
	- Changed number of digits printed out in net flux in rrtm.f
	- Added new rrtatm.f made from lblatm.f v8.1 and updated extra.f to be compatible
	- Removed numatmos option in rrtm.f
	- Removed NUMATMOS option 
	- Updated pressure level formatting to be consistent with RRMT_SW
	- Updated revision number format to be consistent with RRTM_SW/LBLRTM	
	- Updated rrtm_instructions
