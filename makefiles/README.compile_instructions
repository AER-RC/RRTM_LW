Directions to compile RRTM (longwave) on Linux/Unix platforms with
Fortran 90.

* Edit makefiles/makefile.common.  

FC_TYPE = The abbreviated name of the Fortran compiler from column 1, TABLE I.

VERSION = The RRTM version number.  

OUTPUT = The name of the RRTM executable, identified by version,
platform, and compiler type.  

CPATH = The directory containing the source code relative to the
parent directory.

CDOTO = The location where the Fortran object files are stored.

* From parent directory above makefile directory, use the gmake utility and 
  type: gmake -f makefiles/make_rrtm

NOTE: The options in TABLE I can be expanded to include additional
compilers.  See the "COMPILE OPTIONS" portion of the makefile.common
file, and follow a consistent format.
